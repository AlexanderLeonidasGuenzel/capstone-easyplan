# EasyPlan (Java Fullstack Bootcamp - Graduation Project)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my graduation project from the Java Fullstack Bootcamp conducted by "Neue Fische" in the summer of 2023. This project showcases the implementation of essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities.

## Project Description
This project revolves around managing work schedules through a user-friendly interface. Users can create, view, update, and delete work schedules using intuitive actions. Each work schedule can be assigned a name during creation, and this name can be edited later as needed. Entries within the schedule list can be easily removed when they're no longer relevant.

## Future Directions
As part of future enhancements, I plan to integrate advanced features to elevate the utility of this project. Some of the envisioned improvements include:

1. **Interactive Table View:** Display work schedules in the form of an organized table. This table will allow easy visualization of shifts and employee assignments.

2. **Shift Assignment and Auto-calculation:** Implement the ability to assign fixed shifts to employees. The system will automatically calculate and display the weekly working hours for each employee.

I am committed to refining and expanding this project's capabilities to meet the evolving needs of work schedule management. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we continue to enhance this application.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my graduation project. Feel free to review the code, provide feedback, and collaborate to make this project even better.
